        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Delicious, extra crispy potatoes! It's easy, requires very little active cooking time, and uses mostly household ingredients!</p>
        <p>Recipe derived from Kenji Lopez-Alt of <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/">Serious Eats</a>.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Baking Soda</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Optional: Herbs! I recommend sage and thyme.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel and chop potatoes into roughy equal pieces. The smaller the pieces, the lower the cooking time</li>
            <li>Bring water to a boil</li>
            <li>Add a few tablespoons of salt and a teaspoon of baking soda</li>
            <li>Parboil potatoes for 10-15 minutes. If a knife pierces the potato with little to no resistance they're ready</li>
            <li>While potatoes are boiling, mince your garlic (using a garlic crusher is fine)</li>
            <li>Add extra virgin olive oil to a pan, set the pan to medium heat, and add the garlic</li>
            <li>Add any herbs you wish to use. You could also add some chili flakes for some heat</li>
            <li>Cook until the garlic is just starting to turn golden brown, then strain the oil into a bowl 
                (keep the garlic and herbs, we'll use them again later)</li>
            <li>Add the potatoes to the bowl of oil and mix! You'll want a mashed-potato like consistency on the outside</li>
            <li>Put the potatoes on a rack and add them to an oven that's been preheated to about 200c</li>
            <li>Cook for 30-40 minutes, turning halfway through (actual cooking time depends on your oven and the size of the potatoes)</li>
            <li>Toss the potatoes with the garlic (and herbs) immediately after completion. You could optionally add fresh herbs too!</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
