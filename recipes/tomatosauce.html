        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tomato sauce is a great way to get started with cooking! It can be as simple or complex as you like!</p>
        <p>You may cook your sauce for 10 minutes, an hour, or even many hours.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Chili flakes</li>
            <li>Canned tomatoes</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the extra virgin olive oil to a pan, preheat at medium heat for a few minutes</li>
            <li>Mince or crush 3-4 cloves of garlic and add it to the pan. If it starts sizzling aggressively immediately, the pan is too hot</li>
            <li>Add chili flakes to taste. The more chili, the spicier the sauce (obviously)</li>
            <li>When the garlic is just about to turn golden brown, add the canned tomatoes</li>
            <li>If you're using whole canned tomatoes, you could crush them up with a wooden spoon if you want a smoother sauce</li>
            <li>Simmer the sauce for at least 10 minutes, up to hower long you want (if it starts to get too thick, you could add some water)</li>
            <li>When you feel ready to take it off, add some butter to deepen the flavour, then season to taste with salt and pepper</li>
            <li>If you've got some pasta boiling, you could finish it in the sauce!</li>
            <li>Enjoy! or don't, i'm not your boss</li>
        </ol>
